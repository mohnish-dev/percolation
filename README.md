Percolation Simulation Program
This Percolation program simulates the flow of fluid through a grid-based system, utilizing the Weighted Quick Union algorithm for efficient connectivity checks. It models a grid of sites, where each site can be either open or blocked. The program can determine whether a fluid can percolate from the top to the bottom of the grid based on the open sites.

The percolation model can be applied in various fields, including:
Hydrology: Understanding fluid flow in porous materials, such as soil and rocks.
Material Science: Analyzing the permeability of materials and their ability to allow fluids to pass through.
Network Theory: Studying connectivity and robustness in networks, such as social networks or transportation systems.
Environmental Science: Simulating the spread of contaminants through groundwater.
This program provides a foundation for further exploration of percolation theory and its real-world implications.
